Hey. I'm **Kate**, a **writer**, editor, and US expat living in Vancouver, BC.

I'm **currently available for volunteer documentation projects** --- especially REST API projects.

My tools include:

* Sphinx
* reStructuredText
* markdown (including GFM)
* Postman

And I understand* the following languages:

* Python
* HTML/CSS
* JSON
* cURL

**enough to work with their code samples*

I'd add "Git" to the first list, but that one is heavily implied by the URL at the top of this page.

P.S. Nice to meet you.
